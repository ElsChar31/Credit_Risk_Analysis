Supervised Machine Learning
Overview of loan prediction risk analysis
1.	The analysis purpose was to define each customer’s credit risk in the starter file presented to Lending Club.
2.	Lending Club expected these findings to be bias-free determinations. The CEO wanted to preserve customers that could provide Lending Club with ample patronage while concurrently excising entities that would become late-paying or underpaying clients in the short term and bad-debt write-off in the long term.

Summary of Results
1.	The supervised machine learning process revealed that the data provided by the Lending Club CEO contained a large quantity of true negatives indicating that the dataset contained low-risk customers that contribute positively to Lending Club’s P&L margin over time as long-term patrons.
2.	Concurrently, supervised machine learning disclosed that the dataset provided by the Lending Club CEO contained a small quantity of true positives or high-credit risk clients. Lending Club Finance could deny these entities company credit lines without compromising current and future quarterly revenue figures. In addition, given their risk factor, it is unlikely that these true positives will be incorporated into competitors’ respective credit networks. These factors will permit Lending Club to surpass the competition when revenue and profit figures are used as the criteria for success within the industry.
